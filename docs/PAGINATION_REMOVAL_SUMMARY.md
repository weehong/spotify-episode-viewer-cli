# üöÄ Pagination Removal - Browse All Episodes Implementation

## Overview
The Spotify Show Explorer CLI has been updated to remove pagination from the Browse Episodes feature and now fetches all episodes at once, providing a complete view of all episodes in a show.

## Changes Made

### 1. ShowService Enhancement
**New Method: `getAllShowEpisodes()`**
- Fetches all episodes for a show without pagination
- Uses optimized concurrent batch processing (up to 5 concurrent requests)
- Includes error handling and partial failure recovery
- Returns complete episode data with metadata

```javascript
async getAllShowEpisodes(showId) {
    // Get first page to determine total count
    const firstPage = await this.apiClient.getShowEpisodes(showId, { limit: 50, offset: 0 });
    
    // Fetch remaining pages concurrently in batches
    // Returns: { episodes, totalItems, fetchedItems, isComplete }
}
```

### 2. CLI Interface Updates
**Updated Menu Option**
- Changed from "üì∫ Browse show episodes with pagination" 
- To "üì∫ Browse all show episodes"

**New Method: `browseAllEpisodes()`**
- Fetches and displays all episodes at once
- Removes page size selection
- Shows total episode count
- Provides comprehensive episode actions menu

**New Method: `displayAllEpisodes()`**
- Displays all episodes in a formatted table
- Shows episode numbers, titles, dates, durations, and descriptions
- Includes total episode count in header

### 3. Enhanced Episode Actions
**New Method: `showAllEpisodesMenu()`**
- üî¢ Search by episode number
- üéß Episode actions (Open/Copy URL)
- üîç Search episodes by text
- üè† Back to Main Menu

**New Method: `handleSearchEpisodesText()`**
- Search through all episodes by title or description

### 4. CLIService Optimization
**Updated `getAllEpisodes()` Method**
